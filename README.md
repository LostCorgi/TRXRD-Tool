# TRXRD-Tool
For integrating XRD images and doing some time-resolved analysis if necessary

# Getting Started
Download both files. You'll need to have a conda installation on your device, get anaconda if you're really new, or miniconda if you want to save space. The anaconda website should explain the relevant commands to create a new environment using the environment.yml. Once the environment is activated, you can start 'jupyter lab', and make sure it launches from a directory containing the jupyter notebook (.ipynb). At this point, you can use the notebook. Run all the cells and scroll to the bottom. A widget UI should appear, allowing you to interact with the code and do integration. The DSM left panel provides integration functionality as well as several calibration tools and a data saving section, while the second DataViewer panel provides Time-Resolved specific tools that may or may not be useful to you.
